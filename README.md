Uncooperative Toaster is a collection of projects from CS 4253, an Artificial Intelligence class taught by Dr. Sandip Sen at the University of Tulsa.  

## Projects

1. **An introduction to Lisp:** This project contains a variety of short programs designed to help me become familiar with using common lisp.
2. **Connect 4:** A bot that plays a modified version of connect 4 against a human or AI player. It uses a game-tree search with alpha-beta pruning to make play.
3. **Sudoku:** Changing soduku into a constraint-satisfaction problem that is solved via backtracking, forward lookahead, and arc consistency.
4. **Decision Tree:** This project uses basic machine learning algorithms to create a decision tree for classifying items into discrete partitions using binary variables.
5. **Game-rules:** This project uses CLIPS (declarative programming) to make a game about moving through college. *Note: Not included in current repository. May be added at a later date.*
