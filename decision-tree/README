To run my program, you have to copy one of the .data files to in.data, load
the corresponding .domain file and ss.fas into the lisp interpreter, and then
type (run-id3).  

For example, after you have copied weather.data to in.data, within clisp
you can type the following commands in sequence:

(load "weather.domain")
(load "ss.fas")
(run-id3)

This will train a decision tree on the training data and test it on the
training data.  The classification accuracy on training and testing as well
as the learnt tree is printed out.
